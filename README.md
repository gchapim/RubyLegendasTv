## How to use

### Searching

#### Searching for a Movie or Show by name:

<pre><code>#A movie (you can do the same for a Tv Show):
irb(main):004:0> titles = RubyLegendasTv.search_title('The Secret Life of Walter Mitty')
=> [#Title:0x0000000119f928 @name="A Vida Secreta de Walter Mitty", @description="The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", @image_url="/img/poster/214x317/legendas_tv_20131213184132.jpg", @id="31506", @link="/util/carrega_legendas_busca/id_filme:31506"]</code></pre>

now you can get the subtitles using the Title:

<pre><code>irb(main):005:0> subtitles = RubyLegendasTv.search_subtitles_from_title(titles[0])</code></pre>

#### Searching for a subtitle directly (i.e. with a release):

<pre>code>irb(main):006:0> subtitles = RubyLegendasTv.search_subtitles('Arrested Development S04E01 SaM-qrus')

#download link
irb(main):007:0> subtitles[0].download_link
=> "/downloadarquivo/52811bfae781c"</code></pre>

<pre><code>irb(main):008:0> subtitles = RubyLegendasTv.get_most_downloaded_subtitles</code></pre>

<pre><code>irb(main):009:0> subtitles = RubyLegendasTv.get_highlights</code></pre>
